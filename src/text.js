    "Philip Shane, award-winning documentary filmmaker, is raising funds for a brand new documentary. Best known for his work on <span class='documentary'>BEING ELMO</span> (Sundance Film Festival), <span class='documentary'>DANCING IN JAFFA</span> (TriBeCa World Premiere), and <span class='documentary'>EINSTEIN</span> (History Channel), Philip has turned his eye to the classic video game <span class='game'>MYST</span> and the confluence of technologies in the 1990's that drove games to become one of the most transformative cultural forces of the 21st century.",
    "Deeply and personally influenced by <span class='game'>MYST</span>, Shane was always fascinated by the story of its creators, brothers Rand and Robyn Miller, who despite being outside of the game industry (and living in the middle of nowhere) created the bestselling PC game of the 20th century. After Shane met the Miller brothers in 2016 at a conference near his home in Brooklyn, he struck up an instant kinship with them and proposed the concept of a documentary. Since then, he has filmed more than 100 hours of preliminary footage and made the 2,500-mile journey to the Cyan campus in Mead, WA half a dozen times. With pre-production underway, Shane is preparing to launch a Kickstarter this summer to raise funding for what will surely be a must-see documentary for every <span class='game'>MYST</span>, video game, and computer history fan out there.",
    "<h2> About <span class='documentary'>The Myst Documentary</span> </h2>",
    "<span class='documentary'>THE MYST DOCUMENTARY</span> brings to life the unlikely and extraordinary story of two brothers with disparate talents and interests who, in the early 90's, changed the computer game industry forever with the release of <span class='game'>MYST</span>. In 1993, Rand and Robyn Miller, before the world wide web and with few other gaming pioneers to use for inspiration, broke new ground with gorgeously rendered 3D environments, an original script, and an atmospheric musical score to create a virtual experience unlike anything before.",
    "More than a quarter-century later, director Philip Shane is not only documenting the lives of the famous brothers but celebrating the unsung engineers at the forefront of 80's and 90's technology that made <span class='game'>Myst</span> possible: Hypercard, Quicktime, CD-ROM, the Macintosh, Strata Pro, Silicon Graphics. This confluence of technology defined an era in which the Millers were able to leave a mark on  video games, art, entertainment, and culture.",
    "By following the brothers through intimate interviews, Shane shows the journey of Rand and Robyn from their early struggles, epic successes, and personal battles as they continue to pour out their passion and push beyond the limits of technology to create deeply moving experiences for audiences that span generations.",
